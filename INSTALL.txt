CUBIT INSTALL
=============

You are assumed to have BioEdit installed at `C:\BioEdit\`.

* Adding apps to the BioEdit interface

    Place the `accApp.ini` in your `C:\BioEdit\apps\` folder.  This will
    add several of the cubit apps to your BioEdit Accessory Apps menu.

    Advanced users: if you have a customized `accApp.ini` file, you can
    append the records for CUBIT programs from the included .ini file to
    your own .ini file.  The relevent records are near the bottom of the
    included .ini file.

* Unpacking CUBIT

    Double-click on `cubit.zip`.  If windows is set to use the default
    zip file handler, it will pop open an explorer window with a folder
    named cubit.  Drag and drop this folder to `C:\BioEdit\apps\`.  If
    the folder already exists, Windows will ask if you want to
    over-write existing files.  Answer yes.  The main CUBIT package is
    now installed.

* Sequencing Team (and Becky) ONLY

    If you need any of the sequencing-specific applications,
    double-click `cubit_extras.zip`.  Drag and drop the cubit folder to
    `C:\BioEdit\apps\`.  Answer yes when asked about over-writing files.
    The extra CUBIT apps are now installed.
