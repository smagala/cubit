**aadiff** - Generate amino acid difference tables from aligned
nucleotide coding sequences with ambiguities

SYNOPSIS
--------

**aadiff** FILE

*OR*

**aadiff.py** FILE

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Generate an amino acid difference report and difference alignment from a
flush, in-frame nucleotide alignment.  The first sequence in the file
will be used as the reference, and all other sequences will be compared
against it.

FILE should be a multi-fasta formatted file containing aligned
nucleotide sequences.  Sequences are expected to be flush and in-frame.
Mixed base positions indicated by IUPAC DNA degeneracies will be
disambiguated.

Two output files will be generated, with names based on the input FILE.
A 'diff report' will list each position that has a mutation relative to
the reference sequence, as well as the total number of positions that
differ.  A 'diff table' shows an alignment containing only positions
with mutations in the alignment.

For the 'diff table', if a mixed base position is detected that results
in a mixed amino acid, all possible amino acids will be reported, even
though this may result in listing an amino acid that is not, in fact, a
change from the reference sequence.  Note that the reference sequence is
not disambiguated.
