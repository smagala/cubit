CUBIT CHANGELOG
===============

1.0.1
-----

* Added influenza B MP and NS genes to fix_frame.

    * B MP: 1076 nt (1-747, 747-1076)
    * B NS: 1024 nt (1-846, 1-33, 688-1024)

* Bug fix: changed splice sites and length requirements on fix_frame for
influenza A NS genes.  The splices now match NCBI's translations exactly.
This now finds one additional amino acid in the NS2 ORF.

    * A MP:  982 nt (1-759, 1-26, 715-982)
    * A NS:  838 nt (1-639, 1-30, 503-838)

1.0
---

* Compiled several packages, notably the james/james-tool package and
swap_plates, into one coherent package for easy distribution.

* Added GUIs for some of the more complicated command line tools, such
as aadiff.

* Split the package into a main package and an extra package.  The main
package can be freely distributed, while the extra package is for CDC
Influenza Division internal use only.
